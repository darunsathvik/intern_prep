# RTL / Architecture Internship Prep

This repository contains my intensive preparation for RTL Design / Design Verification / Computer Architecture internship roles at companies like NVIDIA, AMD, and Qualcomm.

## Projects

### 1. 5-Stage Pipelined RISC Core (SystemVerilog)
- IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB stages
- Register file and ALU
- Data hazard handling
- Forwarding and stalling logic
- Clean reset and control FSM
- Fully synthesizable RTL

### 2. Parameterized FIFO with Assertions (SystemVerilog)
- Configurable depth and width
- Full/empty detection
- Circular buffer logic
- SystemVerilog assertions
- Self-checking testbench

## Focus Areas
- RTL design best practices
- Timing-aware coding
- FSM design
- Pipeline microarchitecture
- Debugging and verification mindset

This repo is being built as part of a 7-day intensive interview-prep sprint.
